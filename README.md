# Open-Source SATA to USB 3.0 bridge üîß

 The main chip is TUSB9261 from Texas Instruments. It is compatible with SATA 1.5-Gbps or SATA 3.0-Gbps devices. The TUSB9261 comes with loaded firmware. Therefore, you don't have to write firmware.
 
üìç The PCB was designed in 4 layers: Signal-Gnd-Pwr-Signal.

üìç SATA signals are routed as differential pair 100Œ© (single-ended 50Œ©) and length matched within 2.5 mil tolerance.

üìç USB 3.0 super speed signals are also differential pair 90Œ© (single-ended 50Œ©) and length matched.

 üìç JLC04161H-3313 controlled impedance PCB stackup.

üìçThe small fan was used to cool down the main chip. It is optional
