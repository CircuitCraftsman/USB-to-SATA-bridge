# Open-Source SATA to USB 3.0 bridge 🔧

 The main chip is TUSB9261 from Texas Instruments. It is compatible with SATA 1.5-Gbps or SATA 3.0-Gbps devices. The TUSB9261 comes with loaded firmware. Therefore you don't need to write firmware.
 
📍 The PCB was designed in 4 layers: Signal-Gnd-Pwr-Signal.

📍 SATA signals are routed as differential pair 100Ω (single-ended 50Ω) and length matched within 2.5 mil tolerance.

📍 USB 3.0 super speed signals are also differential pair 90Ω (single-ended 50Ω) and length matched.

 📍 JLC04161H-3313 controlled impedance PCB stackup.

📍The small fan was used to cool down the main chip. It is optional
